HLU Tool Database Updater 1.0.0

Copyright © 2014 Sussex Biodiversity Record Centre

Overview
--------
The HLU Tool Database Updater provides an automated mechanism of applying
structural and/or content changes to a target HLU Tool relational database.
It will process one or more script files and execute all the SQL commands
in the files.

The program does not need to be installed - it can be run as a standalone
program and will connect to any of the HLU Tool relation database formats,
including Access, SQL Server, PostgreSQL and Oracle (although connections to
PostgreSQL and Oracle have not been tested).

------------
The HLU Tool Database Updater requires the following:
 - Microsoft Windows XP/2003/2008/Vista/Windows 7 or Windows 8 
 - 2 GHz or higher processor
 - 2 GB RAM
 - 10 MB of free hard disk space
 - Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, 4.0, or 4.5 installed

Instructions
------------
The program does not need to be installed and can be run as a standalone program
by any user with windows administrator privileges and sufficient database permissions
to drop, create & alter tables and to delete, insert, update and select data in
the target relational database.

To run the program:
- Unpack the latest .zip release file (see 'Latest Release' below).

  files from the 'Archive' folder in the 'Scripts' folder back into the
